# Odoo 16 Community Edition 
All modules I have developed using Odoo 16 community edition.

### Web Portal Module
Web Portal Integration for Product Template Form in Sale Module project is designed to enhance the efficiency and 
functionality of the existing business management system by introducing a user-friendly web portal for managing product templates. 

This integration will empower users to create, customize, and maintain product templates easily, improving the overall sales process and customer experience.

### liquor_store_management 
I developed a liquor store management module aimed at streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency in liquor 
inventory, sales, and order processing.

This module utilizes various Odoo features, including sequencing for sale order numbers, generating PDF reports, 
computing fields, implementing widgets, creating wizards, controllers and incorporating other Odoo model and view features.

Created a simple real estate module using Odoo framework with the help of odoo documentation. Customized buying, selling,
management of properties for home and commercial buildings. Gained hands-on experience in working with Odoo's modular structure.
