# Odoo 16 Community Edition 
All modules I have developed using Odoo 16 community edition.


## liquor_store_management 
I developed a liquor store management module aimed at streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency in liquor 
inventory, sales, and order processing.

This module utilizes various Odoo features, including sequencing for sale order numbers, generating PDF reports, 
computing fields, implementing widgets, creating wizards, controllers and incorporating other Odoo model and view features.
